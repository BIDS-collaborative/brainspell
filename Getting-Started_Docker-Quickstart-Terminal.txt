0a. Make sure you downloaded the docker toolbox (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox)

0b. Ensure you have VirtualBox installed.

1. Go into the dav branch.

git checkout dav

2. Go into the docker folder.

cd docker

3. Build the image and launch the container.

docker-compose up

5. Check the host ip.

docker-machine ip

6. Open a browser (use Firefox or Internet Explorer) and type/copy-paste the resulting ip address in step (5) into the address bar. If you are using docker quickstart, it is 192.168.99.100:8000.

7. You should see the brainspell webpage. :)

Troubleshooting:

Internet connection error
Note: Although, even though your computer is connected to the internet, your virtual machine (VM) may not be. This could be because you have changed internet connections.

0a. Connect to the internet. 

1. Stop the VM.

docker-machine Stop

2. Start the VM.

docker-machine start

3. Evaluate the environment (if everything is ok, there will be no output).

eval $(docker-machine env)

4. Check the VM connection by test-running hello-world.

docker run hello-world

5. If the VM is connected, try to build the image and launch the container.

docker-compose up
